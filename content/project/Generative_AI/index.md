In this work, we explored the use of Textual Inversion as a lightweight and effective approach for controlling style in text-to-music generation. Our findingdemonstrate that introducing learned tokens enables reliable steering of musical outputs, even with as few a5â€“6 training examples per style. This highlights thpotential of TI as an efficient method for style conditioning. Our experiments further show that training olonger audio sequences leads to richer token embeddings, improving text-audio alignment as measured bCLAP similarity. Overall, our results suggest that Textual Inversion offers a promising direction for enhancing controllability, consistency, and composability imusic generation systems like MusicGen.
