In quest to obtain efficiency in 3D reconstruction of objects, we enhanced POCO (Point Convolution for Surface Reconstruction) by utilizing Graphical Attention Network for feature learning. Here we treated Point clouds as nodes in a graph and assigned variable weights (feature weighting) to point cloud neighbors and performed Occupancy prediction using a final Linear Layer.
